During the interaction with Dr. Sarah Martin, an oncologist at Nielsen-Norton Clinic, I introduced a new product to her. The interaction took place on November 16, 2023, and it was a follow-up to a previous email communication. 

The purpose of the call was to provide Dr. Martin with information about the new product and discuss the potential for an extended partnership. I highlighted the benefits and features of the product, emphasizing how it could enhance the clinic's oncology services. Dr. Martin showed a keen interest in the product and asked several insightful questions about its efficacy and compatibility with existing treatments.

We discussed the target completion date for the extended partnership, which was set for December 31, 2023. Dr. Martin expressed her willingness to explore this opportunity further and requested additional materials to share with her colleagues at the clinic. I assured her that I would promptly send the requested information via email.

Throughout the interaction, I maintained a professional and informative approach, addressing all of Dr. Martin's concerns and providing her with the necessary information to make an informed decision. I also took note of her contact details, including her email address (sarah.martin@healthmail.com) and phone number (826-503-1750x95606), for future correspondence.

Overall, the interaction with Dr. Martin was positive, and I am optimistic about the potential for a successful partnership with Nielsen-Norton Clinic in the field of oncology.
